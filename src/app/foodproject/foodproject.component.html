    <p class="mt-6">This website allowed for consumers to purchase food from restaurants and have the food
    delivered to them. Restaruants are also able to register their business and import their menus as 
    well as manage incoming orders. Delivery drivers also register on the site, allowing them to
    accept deliveries. All users are able to communicate with each other through the website. Currently
    the site is offline because of cost however, clicking this card will take you to the github repository
    containing all the code and documentation for the Webapp. I will also add screenshots of the site 
    running on my local machine and more in-depth explainations of the different site components.
